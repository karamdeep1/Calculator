# Calculator
Simple calculator

This is a basic calculator built using JavaFX. The calculator has addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, positive/negative, sin, cos, tan, square root,
and square.

To run this application use any Java IDE and compile the code in the `HelloApplication.java` or `HelloController.java` class. 

The calculator has a user friendly interface with buttons for each digit and arithmetic operation. To perform calculations, simply press the digit then the operation
in the order you want. The app only supports 2 operations at a time so future releases will contribute to fixing that.

To contribute to the project one can include trigonometric functions.
